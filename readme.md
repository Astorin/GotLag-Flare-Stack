Adds four new structures for removing unwanted fluids, gases and items:

* Flare Stack - destroys liquids and gases, with a giant flame and emitted light
* Gas Vent - vents liquids and gases without the light show
* Incinerator - uses fuel to destroy any non fuel item (and wood)
* Electric Incinerator - like the incinerator only using electric power, and can destroy any fuel item

Please note that burner incinerators won't destroy fuel items, with a specific exception made for wood. This is so the incinerator can be supplied with belted fuel without simply destroying all of it and ignoring other items.

As of Flare Stack 2.1.5 there is now a mod setting to control how many units of fluid are burned per second. Default is 10.

As of Flare Stack 2.1.0 for Factorio 0.15, the only difference between the flare stack and gas vent is cosmetic, they both destroy any fluid. Incinerators now only destroy solid items.

In 0.14, the flare/vent lists need to be manually defined. For more details and instructions on adding custom fluids to the Flare Stack or Gas Vent recipe lists, see [the forums thread](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=93&t=21586).
