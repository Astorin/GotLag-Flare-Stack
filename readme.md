Adds 3 new structures for removing unwanted fluids, gases and items:

* Flare Stack - destroys liquids and gases
* Incinerator - uses fuel to destroy any non fuel item (and wood)
* Electric Incinerator - like the incinerator only using electric power, and can destroy any fuel item

There is a mod setting to control how many units of fluid are burned per second. Default is 10.
